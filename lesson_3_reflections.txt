When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I'm collaborating with other people and perhaps whenever I want to store a project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It let's me specify the version I want to work on currently.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I'm collaborating with other people and perhaps whenever I want to store a project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It let's me specify the version I want to work on currently.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Forks are kinda a way to clone repositories on github servers, whilst via clone you can copy a repository locally. Fork is completely a thing of github. And in terms branches are a completely different thing. There you start from a given point in time(a certain commit and add a new feature then merge it with another branch and so on). I'd use fork when I want to contribute to a foreign project. Clone when I would want to work on top of my project locally. Branches when I would want to add a new feature.
